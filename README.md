# University_ComSci_Assignments

This is a collection of assignments from the more important papers I've completed at University

AlgorithmsAndDataStructures_Assignments
- For this paper's assignments, we had to implement data structures and algorithms that we were learning about in class
- These included:
- Linked Lists Implementation Project
- Stacks Implementation Project(using LinkedLists)
- Queue Implementation Project (using LinkedLists)
- Big Number Addition Project (using LinkedLists to store the numbers)
- Tree Implementation Project (using std::stack)
- Graph Implementation Project (using LinkedLists)
- Heap Implementation Project (using std::vector)

ComputerNetworks_Assignments
- For this paper's assignments, we were supplied starter code and then had to implement basic versions of concepts
-   we were learning in class.
- This included:
- Creating a Simple Active FTP Server
- Project for Reliable Data Transfer (UDP)
- Project for Cryptography (RSA with CBC)

ObjectOrientedProgramming
- For this paper's assignments, There was a total of 2 assignments which were split into 2 parts.
- Assignment 1
- I didn't archive Assignment 1, but it was about creating a Basic storage system for town library, which
-   would had a class of type Item from which classes Book, DVD & CD inherited/derived from.
- Assignment 2
- We had to recreate a basic implementation of std::vector using classes and templating.
